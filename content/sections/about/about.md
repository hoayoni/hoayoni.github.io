I grew up and started my career in Singapore as a marketer, afterwhich I moved to S. Korea in 2018 for a new adventure as a Product Manager.

As a PM, I love to simplify steps and logics when building things, so that products and teams can stay lean and move fast.

Currently, I am building a marketing solution service called 'adops'. Learn more about it on www.adriel.com.

Occasionally, I also work as a Korean-English interpreter for commercial shootings. <a href="/interpreter">Find more.</a>
